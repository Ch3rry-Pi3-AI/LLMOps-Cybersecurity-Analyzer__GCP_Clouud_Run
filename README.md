# 🛡️ LLMOps Cybersecurity Analyzer — Repository Setup

This branch covers the initial setup—getting the project onto your machine and opening it in your editor so you can explore the structure.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Begin by cloning the project from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ch3rry-Pi3-AI/LLMOps-Cybersecurity-Analyzer.git
cd LLMOps-Cybersecurity-Analyzer
```

This downloads the project and moves you into the root directory.

## Step 2: Open the Project in VS Code (or Cursor)

1. Launch VS Code or Cursor
2. Select **File → New Window**
3. Select **File → Open Folder**
4. Find and select the `LLMOps-Cybersecurity-Analyzer` folder
5. Click **Open**

Your editor will load the full project structure.

## Step 3: Explore the Project Structure

You should now see a layout similar to:

```
LLMOps-Cybersecurity-Analyzer/
  backend/
  frontend/
  terraform/
  assets/
  airline.py
  Dockerfile
  .dockerignore
  .gitignore
  README.md
```

Key components:

* **frontend/** — Next.js React interface
* **backend/** — FastAPI service powering the security analysis
* **terraform/** — IaC for Azure and GCP deployment
* **airline.py** — additional experimental agent example

If you'd like, I can prepare the README for the next branch as well.
